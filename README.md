# Repository Structure

This repository contains my technical writing portfolio in **English and German** 
and demonstrates my approach to task-oriented software documentation, 
including information architecture and DITA fundamentals.

Language variants are handled using language-specific directory structures, 
reflecting how output targets or translation memories are managed in DITA-based workflows.
