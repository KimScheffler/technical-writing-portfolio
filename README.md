## About This Portfolio

The portfolio demonstrates my approach to **task-oriented software documentation**, 
including information architecture, DITA fundamentals, and user-centered content design.

In a professional **DITA-based documentation workflow**, language variants are typically managed 
through **separate output targets** or **translation memories**.  
For this portfolio, I simulate this approach using **language-specific directory structures**, 
while keeping content structure and information types consistent across languages.

## Topics Covered

- Task-oriented documentation (procedures and workflows)
- Functional vs. task-based documentation
- DITA information types (Concept, Task, Reference)
