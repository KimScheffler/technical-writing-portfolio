# Professional Summary

I am a Technical Writer with a strong focus on **task-oriented software documentation** and 
structured information architecture. My goal is to make complex technical systems 
understandable, usable, and maintainable through clear, precise, and user-centered documentation.

### Documentation Approach

I work according to established principles of **task-based documentation**, starting from 
user goals rather than system features. Documentation is structured around real user tasks 
and supported by conceptual and reference information where it adds value.

This approach helps users achieve their goals efficiently while keeping documentation concise 
and easy to maintain.

### Methodological Focus

I am familiar with the **DITA information model (Concept, Task, Reference)** and apply its core 
ideas—modularity, reusability, and separation of information types—even when working in 
lightweight formats such as Markdown and GitHub-based documentation.

### Core Principles

In my documentation process, I place strong emphasis on:
- clear audience definition and user needs
- logical information architecture
- consistent terminology and style
- concise, active, and legally precise language

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to translate technical complexity into structured, 
task-focused documentation and reflects my methodological approach to professional 
technical writing for software products.
