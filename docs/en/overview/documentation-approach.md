# Documentation Approach (DITA-based)

This page describes the **methodological documentation approach** I apply in technical
documentation projects—from initial analysis to continuous improvement.

The approach is based on established principles of professional technical documentation, with a
strong focus on **task-oriented documentation**, clear information architecture, and consistently
user-centered content.

All methods and principles described here are applied across the documentation examples in this
portfolio, including the **Windows Snipping Tool** and **memoQ** projects as well as the associated **glossaries**
and **style guide**.

## Methodological Overview

The following diagram provides an overview of the principles and steps underlying this
documentation approach and illustrates the full documentation lifecycle.

The diagram illustrates the key phases of the documentation process—from user analysis to
continuous improvement.

## From User Analysis to Structured Documentation

The documentation process begins with a clear understanding of **who the users are** and
**what goals they want to achieve** (see steps 1–2 in the diagram).

At this stage, target audiences and user roles are identified, typical tasks and usage scenarios
are analyzed, and information needs and usage contexts are clarified.

As part of this approach, **style guides, terminology standards, and writing conventions** are
defined early to ensure consistent UI naming, tone, and structure across all documentation (step 3).
Global style guides and project-specific glossaries support consistency, content reuse, and
long-term maintainability.

This analysis forms the foundation for all subsequent documentation decisions.

## Information Architecture and Content Design

Designing a clear and logical information architecture is a central component of the applied
approach (steps 4–7 in the diagram).

At this stage, the **documentation format** is defined and appropriate **tools** for content
creation and maintenance are selected (steps 4–5).

The structure used throughout this portfolio follows the **DITA information model** and therefore
corresponds directly to the content models implemented in DITA-based component content management
systems (CCMS) such as **SCHEMA ST4**, **Adobe Experience Manager Guides**, **oXygen XML Author**,
or **IXIASOFT CCMS**.

The content structure is task-oriented and based on a clear separation of **Concept**, **Task**, and
**Reference**. This separation is applied consistently across all documentation topics in the
portfolio and reflects the same logical structure used in industrial CCMS environments—independent
of whether the content is authored in XML or maintained in a Markdown-based workflow.

## Writing, Review, and Continuous Improvement

Documentation is created iteratively (steps 8–12 in the diagram).

During this phase, content is written, reviewed, and refined with a focus on clarity, technical
accuracy, and consistency. **Visual elements** are used selectively where they support
understanding. Reusable graphics and UI elements are maintained centrally whenever possible to
avoid redundancy and improve maintainability.

After publication, feedback and usage insights are continuously incorporated into further
documentation development. Documentation is treated as a **living product** that evolves
alongside the product and user requirements.

## Guiding Principles

Across all documentation projects, the following principles are applied consistently:

- user goals before system features  
- clarity and simplicity as guiding priorities  
- consistency in structure, terminology, and style  
- maintainability and reusability of content  

This approach enables the creation of documentation that effectively supports users while
remaining sustainable for development and documentation teams.
