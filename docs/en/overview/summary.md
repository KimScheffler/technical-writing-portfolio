# Professional Summary

Technical Writer with a scientific background and several years of experience in
translation, localization, and quality assurance. Focused on creating clear,
structured, and **task-oriented documentation** for complex technical and scientific
content.

With a degree in **Bio- and Environmental Process Engineering** and hands-on
laboratory and research experience, I bring strong domain knowledge in
biotechnology and life sciences.

As part of my technical writing training, I apply a **DITA-based documentation
approach**, with a clear separation of Concept, Task, and Reference content,
consistent information architecture, and the use of style guides and glossaries
in Markdown- and GitHub-based workflows.
