## Professional Summary

**Technical Writer** with a scientific background and several years of experience in translation, localization, and quality assurance, specializing in clear, structured, and task-oriented documentation for software and technical systems.

With a degree in **Bio- and Environmental Process Engineering** and hands-on laboratory and research experience, I bring strong domain knowledge in biotechnology and life sciences, enabling me to understand complex subject matter and translate it into precise, user-focused documentation.

I work with a **DITA-based documentation approach**, ensuring a clear separation of **Concept**, **Task**, and **Reference** content, consistent information architecture, and high terminological consistency. My workflow is supported by **style guides and glossaries** and implemented in Markdown- and GitHub-based documentation environments.
