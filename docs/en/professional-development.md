## Portfolio Relevance

This course provided the methodological foundation for my documentation approach and 
directly informed the structure and principles demonstrated in this portfolio.

Rather than focusing on tools alone, the training emphasized **process, structure, and 
user-centered thinking**, which aligns with my approach to professional technical writing 
and documentation architecture.
