## What is the Windows Snipping Tool?

The **Windows Snipping Tool** is a Windows application used to create, edit, and save  
**screenshots** and **screen recordings**.

With the Snipping Tool, you can capture specific areas of the screen, individual windows, or the entire screen—for example for documentation, communication, or support purposes.

This documentation describes core Snipping Tool features as available in **Windows 11**. Individual features or user interface elements may vary depending on the Windows version or application updates.
