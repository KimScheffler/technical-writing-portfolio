# Documentation Approach (DITA-based)

This page describes my methodological approach to technical writing and how I structure 
documentation projects from initial analysis to continuous improvement.

My work is guided by established principles of professional technical writing, with a strong 
focus on task-oriented documentation, clear information architecture, and user-centered content.

## Methodological Overview

The following diagram provides a high-level overview of the principles and steps that guide my 
documentation work throughout the documentation lifecycle.

My documentation approach is based on the DITA information model and consistently distinguishes 
between **Concept**, **Task**, and **Reference** content to ensure clarity, reuse, and 
maintainability.

## From User Analysis to Structured Content

My documentation process starts with a clear understanding of **who the users are** and 
**what they want to achieve** (see steps 1–3 in the diagram).

Before writing any content, I focus on:
- identifying target audiences and user roles  
- understanding user goals and typical tasks  
- clarifying information needs and usage contexts  

This analysis provides the foundation for all subsequent documentation decisions.

## Information Architecture and Content Design

Designing a clear and logical information architecture is a central part of my approach 
(steps 4–7).

At this stage, I focus on:
- structuring content around user tasks rather than system features  
- separating information into Concept, Task, and Reference topics  
- defining consistent terminology and navigation paths  

This structured approach helps ensure that documentation remains understandable, scalable, and 
easy to maintain over time.

## Writing, Review, and Continuous Improvement

Writing the documentation is treated as an iterative process (steps 8–12).

After creating an initial version, I focus on:
- validating technical accuracy with subject matter experts  
- improving clarity, precision, and consistency  
- using visuals such as images or diagrams where they support understanding  

After publication, user feedback and usage insights are used to continuously improve the content. 
Documentation is treated as a **living product**, not a one-time deliverable.

## Guiding Principles

Across all documentation projects, I consistently apply the following principles:
- user goals before system features  
- clarity and simplicity over completeness  
- consistency in structure, terminology, and style  
- maintainability and reusability of content  

This approach allows me to create documentation that supports users effectively while remaining 
sustainable for development and documentation teams.
