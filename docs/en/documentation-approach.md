# Documentation Approach (DITA-based)

This page describes my methodological approach to technical writing and how I structure 
documentation projects from initial analysis to continuous improvement.

My work is guided by established principles of professional technical writing, with a strong 
focus on task-oriented documentation, clear information architecture, and user-centered content.

## Methodological Overview

The diagram illustrates the main stages of my documentation process, providing a 
shared frame of reference for the sections below.

The diagram illustrates the main stages of my documentation process, from initial 
user analysis to continuous improvement.

## From User Analysis to Structured Content

My documentation process starts with a clear understanding of **who the users are** and 
**what they want to achieve** (see steps 1–3 in the diagram).

At this stage, I focus on identifying target audiences and user roles, understanding user 
goals and typical tasks, and clarifying information needs and usage contexts.

In addition, I define applicable **style guides and writing standards** early in the process 
to ensure consistent terminology, tone, and structure across all documentation.

This analysis forms the foundation for all subsequent documentation decisions.

## Information Architecture and Content Design

Designing a clear and logical information architecture is a central part of my approach 
(steps 4–7 in the diagram).

At this stage, I define the **documentation format** and select appropriate **tools** for 
content creation and maintenance (steps 4–5).

The **content structure** is then designed using a task-oriented approach and based on the 
**DITA information model**, with a clear distinction between **Concept**, **Task**, and 
**Reference** content (step 6).

Finally, I define the **output channels** and align navigation and terminology accordingly 
to ensure a consistent documentation experience across formats (step 7).

This structured approach helps ensure that documentation remains understandable, scalable, 
and easy to maintain over time.

## Writing, Review, and Continuous Improvement

Writing the documentation is treated as an iterative process 
(steps 8–12 in the diagram).

At this stage, content is created, reviewed, and refined with a focus on clarity, 
accuracy, and consistency. Visual elements are used where they support understanding 
and complement the written content.

After publication, feedback and usage insights are incorporated to continuously 
improve the documentation. Documentation is treated as a **living product**, evolving 
alongside the software and user needs.

## Guiding Principles

Across all documentation projects, I consistently apply the following principles:
- user goals before system features  
- prioritizing clarity and simplicity
- consistency in structure, terminology, and style  
- maintainability and reusability of content  

This approach allows me to create documentation that supports users effectively while remaining 
sustainable for development and documentation teams.
