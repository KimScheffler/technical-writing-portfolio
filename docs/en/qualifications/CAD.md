## Mechanical Engineering & Technical Drawing

### Relevance for Technical Writing

Working with **CAD models**, **technical drawings**, and **standards-compliant representations**
has strengthened my understanding of mechanical principles, technical systems, and
formal requirements—particularly with regard to:

- clearly describing technical functions and operational processes  
- using technical terminology precisely and consistently  
- structuring complex information for different target audiences  
- confidently applying DIN standards and technical drawing conventions  

Through supervising students and reviewing technical assignments, I also developed the
ability to **explain technical concepts clearly and comprehensibly**, identify typical
points of misunderstanding, and adapt content to the needs of the intended audience.

These competencies translate directly to the creation of **operating instructions,
maintenance manuals, and service documentation**, as well as to structured technical
documentation in mechanical and plant engineering contexts.

### Research Assistant – Chair of Mechanical Design Engineering  
*RPTU Kaiserslautern, Chair of Mechanical Design Engineering (2011–2016)*

During my work as a research assistant at the Chair of Mechanical Design Engineering,
I gained hands-on experience in **technical drawing**, **descriptive geometry**, and
**CAD-based modeling**.

**Key responsibilities and focus areas:**

- Creation of basic CAD models using **Solid Edge**, **NX**, and **Pro/ENGINEER**
  for exercise sheets and examination tasks  
- Academic support and supervision of students, particularly regarding exercises
  and exam-related questions  
- Review and assessment of assignments in **descriptive geometry and technical drawing**  
- Verification of standards-compliant dimensioning, sectional views, and correct
  technical representation in accordance with applicable **DIN standards**

This role significantly shaped my understanding of **standards compliance**, **formal
documentation requirements**, and the clear presentation of complex technical content.
