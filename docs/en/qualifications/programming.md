# Professional Development & Qualifications

## Programming with MATLAB and Python

### Relevance for Technical Writing

My programming and data analysis experience supports my work as a
Technical Writer by enabling me to understand, assess, and clearly document
technical workflows, data-driven processes, and software-based analyses.

This technical background also facilitates **effective communication with
software developers and technical experts**, as I am able to follow technical
concepts, data structures, and processing logic and ask targeted, meaningful
questions.

In particular, when creating task-oriented software documentation, this
interface competence helps me structure complex subject matter precisely,
make assumptions transparent, and consistently consider both developer and
user perspectives.

### Research Assistant – Programming with MATLAB  
*RPTU Kaiserslautern, Department of Metrology & Sensor Technology (2018)*

As part of my work as a Research Associate, I used MATLAB to analyze and process
image-based surface measurement data.

The goal of the project was the **determination of surface height topography**
based on multiple optical image acquisitions.

#### Tasks and Methodology

- Processing of image stacks from optical surface measurements
- Application of pattern recognition to align and overlay images at pixel level
- Conversion of image data into a matrix for numerical processing
- Calculation of maximum values representing the respective focal planes
- Derivation of surface topography from the determined focus positions,
  taking into account the known distance between individual images
