## Technical Writing: How to Write Software Documentation  
*JPDocu School of Technical Writing*

I completed the online course **Technical Writing: How to Write Software Documentation**, a practice-oriented training program focused on modern software documentation workflows and fundamental professional methods of software documentation.

The course provides a structured introduction to documenting software products and is delivered by **Jordan Stanchev**, User Assistance Development Architect and founder of the JPDocu School of Technical Writing.

The methods and workflows taught in this course are consistently applied across the documentation examples in this portfolio (for example, the Snipping Tool, memoQ, and the Style Guide).
